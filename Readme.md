# OpenGL Presentation Summer 2016

When interviewing for a Google Developer Advocate position they require you to give a 25 minute presentation. I went a little overboard and built a MacOS App written in Objective-C++ and OpenGL 4. 

**Note:** Some parts of this presentation are VERY rough (like the presentation navigation). This mostly represents a culmination of ideas and me testing MANY MANY different things. In no way should this be a model for how to design a mac app or OpenGL best practices. 

That being said, there are some useful bits that I'll definitely reuse in future OpenGL Mac Apps. Like the OpenGL screen connector and Assimp bits.

Cheers!
