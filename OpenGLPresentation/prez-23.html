    <h1>Theory: Shaders</h1>
    <p>How does the GPU actually translate those vertices and indices you stored as arrays into pixels on the screen?</p><p> Well it's complicated... and sadly it's 90% your responsibility.</p>
    <p>It begins by making programs called <strong>Shaders</strong>. In OpenGL there are two <em>required</em> kinds of shaders, <strong>Vertex</strong> and <strong>Fragment</strong>.
    </p><p>
    Vertex Shaders are ran on each vertex you feed in.<br/>
    Fragment Shaders are ran for each pixel in the glViewport.
