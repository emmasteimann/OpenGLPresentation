    <h1>Vertices</h1>
    <p>In OpenGL (as well as other graphics APIs) these are called vertices.</p><p>They're the building blocks of a much larger idea. When programming graphics we like to represent surfaces. Surfaces begin with defining positions that roughly map out to the object we're describing.</p></body>
