    <h1>Theory: Entry Points</h1>
    <p>
    Often when interacting when interacting with any API, it's helpful to think in terms of <strong>entry points</strong>. OpenGL has a preferred workflow (often called a <em>pipeline</em>).</p>

    <p>At various entry points in the pipeline, not only do you prepare items in it context, you also write programs called <strong>Shaders</strong> that tells the GPU where to draw each vertex on the screen and how to rasterize the colors of the surfaces described.</p>
