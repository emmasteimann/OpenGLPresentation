    <h1>Theory: 3D Transformation</h1>
    <p>But wait... where's the cube?</p>
    <p>Well, there it is. It's just the cube is matching the viewport dimensions exactly. <br/> Which brings us to another important concept, and another reason OpenGL is crazy frustrating.</p>
    <p><strong>You have to do your own 3D math.</strong></p>
    <p>To actually see the cube we must first take its dimensions and translate it into world that's a larger size than itself. For this we use <strong>matrix math</strong>!</p>
